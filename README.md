> A simplistic Progressive Web App (PWA) to get up to date astronomical weather data.

I created this PWA because I have to work with astronomical weather data pretty frequently, and I got tired of using out of date web sites and jumping through hoops just to get astronomical weather data for specific dates.

This PWA makes that easy with three simple steps.

1. Search for the city to get astro data from
2. Select the start date
3. Select the end date

It's that simple.

I'll be adding additional features in the near future.
